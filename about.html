            <p class="bioP">Hi! I’m Carly, also known as, “The Remedy Witch.” I am a PA licensed esthetician, massage therapist, and Usui Reiki
            master currently offering holistic rituals for self care in NEPA. I have studied both Western and Eastern approaches to
            skincare, bodywork, and healing over the past 5 years. I incorporate vibrational sound therapy, aromatherapy, and
            crystal healing into my treatments to deepen the mind/body connection.</p>

            <p class="bioP">My skincare rituals consist of ancient techniques paired with locally made, small-batch, botanical products. Offering
            both results and relaxation, my goal was to create a safe space for all. I utilize the traditional Chinese method known
            as “gua sha,” a modality that aids in sinus relief, lymphatic drainage, and enhances the complexion from the inside out.
            I am inspired by the harshness free ingredients that make up the Korean skincare industry and focus on the importance of
            long term skin wellness.</p>

            <p class="bioP">My approach to massage therapy is to treat the body as a whole and to determine the root cause or source of pain. I am
            here to provide insight, create awareness, and assist you on your therapeutic journey. Each session is customized to not
            only address your current problem areas, but to also prevent muscle tension and stagnation in the body. I will also be
            specializing in John Barnes method of myofascial release after completing his in depth training this Spring in
            Sedona, Arizona. I plan to deepen my understanding of how we hold on to trauma in our body and how we can release it. I
            am excited to bring this healing modality back to the mountains of PA.</p>

            <p class="bioP">In my personal life, I enjoy spending time with my husband and four cats. We enjoy long hikes in the woods and slow
            mornings filled with yoga and meditation. We are so thrilled to be a part of a beautiful community of healers at
            Pathways to Inner Healing.</p>

            <p class="bioP">Sending you LOVE and LIGHT</p>
